/**
 * @task
 * Create a function that works as follows:
 * * The function name is 'totalRoomsArea'
 * * The function takes an object as an argument
 * * The argument type is "TotalRoomsAreaArgs"
 * * The argument must be destructed into 3 items
 * * Consider every destructured item as the area of one room
 * * The function returns the total area of 3 rooms
 * * The argument type must be annotated
 * * The function return type must be annotated
 * * You can use any type of function syntax!
 * Example: totalRoomsArea({ room1: 24, room2: 35, room3: 24 }) => 83
 * Example: totalRoomsArea({ room1: 16, room2: 29, room3: 31 }) => 76
 * !!! The function must be exported !!!

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-6"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
