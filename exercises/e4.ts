 * Example: logMyInfo('Andrey', 18) => 'My name is Andrey. I am 18 years old!'
 * Example: logMyInfo('Jon', 23) => 'My name is Jon. I am 23 years old!'

 */

// Your code goes here...
export const logMyInfo = (name: string, age: number) =>
  console.log(`My name is ${name}. I am ${age} years old!`);

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-4"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
